# Remote-Pi-Lab
The repository aims to develop a remote pi lab where students are able to alter the RB Pis setup locally an access the data remotely to enable group work without local group interaction. The Idea is based on the BMBF 2017 financed ELab Project from the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg under Prof. Sebastian Zug who currently (2021) teaches at the TU Freiberg, Germany.
